# Links
## Types of Links
1. Absolute URL: starts with the domain name of the site. It is used when linking another website. 
2. Relative URL: Used to link another page in the same website. 

### Types of Relative URL:
(if the file we want to link exists in:)

* Same folder: href="filename"
* Chile folder: href="childfolder/filename"
* Grandchild folder: href="childfolder/grandchildfolder/filename"
* Parent folder: href="../filename"
* Grandparent folder: href="../../filename"

## What to do with links:
* open up the email program of the user using the *mailto* attribute.
* Open links in a new window using the *target* attribute.
* Link to a part of the same page usin the *id* attribute.
* Link to a specific part of another page using the suitable URL type and *id.*

# CSS Layout
## Types of Boxes/Elements
1. BLock-level elements: start on a new line
2. Inline elements: flow between the surrounding text
## Element Position
We can control the posiotion of those elements on the web page in different ways:
1. Normal flow: every block-level element appears on a new line. {position: static;
2. Relative positioning: shifts elements to top, bottom, right, left. {position: relative;
3. Absolute positioning: positioned in relation to its containing element and moves when we scroll. {position: absolute;
4. Fixed positioning: positioned in relation to the web browser page and does not move when scrollinh. {position: fixed;
5. Floating elements: position to the far right or left. {float: right/left;

# Functions in JavaScript
* Functions prevent us from repeating codes since they can be reused.
* We create a function by giving it a name and adding the statements that will perform the task. This is called function declaration.
* We call a function by adding its name.
* If a function requires input information, we use parameters after the name.


## Miscellaneous Notes:

* It is better to organize the code by placing the pages of each different section of the site into a new folder/directory.
* There are relationships between the folder and files of website and they are described using the family tree. 
* A **containing element** is a block-level element that contains another block-level element/s.
* We can use *z-index* property to control which element appears in top in case of overlap.
* When designing a web page, developers must take into consideration screen resolution and size.
* fixed width layouts don't change size when we change the screen size.
* We can create a web page with multiple culomns using *float.*
