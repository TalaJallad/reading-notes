# Forms
## What can we use forms for?
* Text input
* Password input
* Radio buttons
* Checkoxes
* Drop-dowb boxes
* Submit buttons
* Image buttons
* File upload
## Notes:
* We use the *input* tag when we want to create a form that asks users to input info.
* To create drop down boxes, use the *select* tag with the *option* element.
* To allow the user to choose multiple options, use the *multiple* attribute.
* The input type to upload files is *file*.
* The input type to submit files is *submit*.
* The input type to use an image for the submit button is *image*.
* The *button* tag is used to allow users to control their submissions;they can add another image, text, etc.
* The *label* element can be used in two ways. It can:
1. Wrap around both the text description and the form input.
2. Be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute to indicate which form control it is a label for. 
* The **for** attribute states which form control the label belongs to.
* We can group related form controls together inside the *fieldset* element. 
* The *legend* element can come directly after the opening *fieldset* tag and contains a caption which helps identify the purpose of that group of form controls.
* Form validation used to tell the user if they filled their info correctly.
# Tables
* The border-spacing property allows you to control the distance between adjacent cells.
* We can style submit buttons on CSS
* We use the cursor property in css to chnage its shape.
